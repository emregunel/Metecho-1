# TasksTable

**Shows a list of tasks within an Epic.**

## Overview

The **TasksTable** component is an
[SLDS DataTable](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/data-tables/)
that shows a list of **Tasks** and their respective current statuses within an
**Epic**.

**Tasks** are shown in the order of three status categories:

1. `In Progress`, `Approved`, or `Changes Requested`
2. `Planned`
3. `Complete`

Within the three categories, sorting is alphabetical by **Task** `Name`.

## Sub-components

### Columns & Cells

**Tasks**

A description of the **Task** that links to its details page.

**Status**

Displays the **Task**'s status based on the work of the `Developer` and the
`Tester`.

- A **Task** begins with a status of `Planned` until a `Scratch Org` has been
  created, which updates the status to `In Progress`.
- It remains `In Progress` until a `Tester` submits a review, at which point the
  status becomes `Changes Requested` or `Approved`.
- If changes are retrieved and a commit is made after review, it becomes
  `In Progress` until another review from the `Tester` is submitted.
- The review status is only shown if the review was submitted on the _most
  recent commit_ of the **Task** branch. Otherwise it is `In Progress`.
- Once the **Task** pull request has been merged on GitHub, it becomes
  `Complete`.

**Developer**

GitHub user assigned as `Developer` for a **Task**.

**Tester**

GitHub user assigned as `Tester` for a **Task**.

**Note**: **Tasks** without an assigned `Developer` or `Tester` display buttons
that allow the selection of a GitHub `Collaborator` from the parent epic to
fulfill the specified role.
