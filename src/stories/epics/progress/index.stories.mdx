# Epic Progress

**Visualize the overall progress/status of the entire project.**

## Overview

The **Epic Progress** component visualizes the progress made on Tasks within an
Epic.

## Guidelines

It accepts a `range` (`[number, number]`) with the first number representing the
number of `Completed` **Tasks** in a project, and the second representing the
total number of project tasks.

<Canvas>
  <EpicProgress range={[7, 13]} />
</Canvas>

When all the **Tasks** in a project are complete, a
[color modifier](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/progress-bar/#Modifiers)
changes the progress bar from blue to green.

<Canvas>
  <EpicProgress range={[10, 10]} />
</Canvas>
