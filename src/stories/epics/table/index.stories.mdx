# EpicTable

**Shows a list of Epics.**

## Overview

**Epics** are bodies of work that are large enough to be broken down to a number
of smaller **Tasks** within a given **Project**.

The **EpicTable** renders an
[SLDS DataTable](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/data-tables/)
accepting a collection of **Epics** to render in the table. This allows users to
view a list of **Epics** and their related information created within a given
**Project**.
