# EpicTable

**Shows a list of epics.**

## Overview

**Epics** are bodies of work that are large enough to be broken down to a number
of smaller **Tasks** within a given **Project**.

The **EpicTable** renders an
[SLDS DataTable](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/data-tables/)
accepting a collection of `epics` to render in the table. This allows users to
view a list of epics and their related information created within a given
project.
