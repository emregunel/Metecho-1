# CommitList

**Shows a history of changes on a task.**

## Overview

The **CommitList** component is a data table that shows the GitHub commit
history of a **Task**. This makes it possible to see at a glance how a **Task**
has changed over time.

As commits are created, they are automatically added as entries to the data
table with the following details, provided from the GitHub API: commit id, user
avatar, and a timestamp of when the commit was executed.
