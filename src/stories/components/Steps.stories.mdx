# Steps

**Show collaborators what to do next.**

## Overview

The **Steps** component communicates the individual steps and progress of a
particular process.

It renders a customized version of the
[vertical progress indicator](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/progress-indicator/#Vertical),
with toned-down colors as to not draw the user's attention away from more
important pieces of information on the page.

**Steps** can optionally:

- Display the avatar of an assigned user.
- Render as a clickable `<button>` to perform an action.
- Render as an `<a>` to link to an external URL.
